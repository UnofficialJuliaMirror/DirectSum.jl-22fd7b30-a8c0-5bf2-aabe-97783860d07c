This package is a work in progress providing the necessary tools to work with arbitrary dual `VectorSpace` elements with optional origin. Due to the parametric type system for the generating `VectorSpace`, the Julia compiler can fully preallocate and often cache values efficiently ahead of run-time.

Although intended for use with the [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) package, `DirectSum` can be used independently.

## Direct-sum yields `VectorSpace` parametric type polymorphism ⨁

Let `N` be the dimension (number of indices) of a `VectorSpace{N}`.
The metric signature of the basis elements of a vector space `V` can be specified with the `V"..."` constructor by using `+` and `-` to specify whether the basis element of the corresponding index squares to `+1` or `-1`.
For example, `V"+++"` constructs a positive definite 3-dimensional `VectorSpace`.
```Julia
julia> ℝ^3 == V"+++" == VectorSpace(3)
true
```
The direct sum operator `⊕` can be used to join spaces (alternatively `+`), and `'` is an involution which toggles a dual vector space with inverted signature.
```Julia
julia> V = ℝ'⊕ℝ^3
⟨-+++⟩

julia> V'
⟨+---⟩'

julia> W = V⊕V'
⟨-++++---⟩*
```
The direct sum of a `VectorSpace` and its dual `V⊕V'` represents the full mother space `V*`.

Not to be confused with the *dual basis*, to generate *dual numbers* it is possible to specify a degenerate basis element with `ϵ` at the first index, i.e. `V"ϵ+++"`
Optionally, an additional element can be specified as the *origin* by using `o` instead, i.e. `V"o+++"` or `V"ϵo+++"`.
These two basis elements will be interpreted in the type system such that they propagate under transformations when combining a mixed index sets (provided the signature is compatible).

The index number `N` of the `VectorSpace` corresponds to the total number of generator elements, but even though `V"ϵo+++"` of type `VectorSpace{5,3}` has standard generator elements, it can be internally recognized in the direct sum algebra as being generated by a 3-index `VectorSpace{3,0}` due to the encoding of the degenerate and origin elements with `M` in the `VectorSpace{N,M}` type.

### Future work

This package is still in its beginning stages and may have deprecating changes.
